<h1><strong>Preparing input files</strong></h1>
<p>Input files must be either comma-separated values (CSV) or
tab-separated values (TSV). There are two options for preparing input
files:</p>
<p><strong>Option 1</strong>: Use the File Builder function to ensure
that you are using the proper taxa attributes and stream classes for the
P51 calculation. See the <strong>Within the App: File Builder</strong>
sub-tab for details.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2</strong>: Generate a file outside of the Shiny app
that is ready to go (i.e., has all the required fields, with exact
column heading names). See the <strong>Outside the app</strong> sub-tab
for details.</p>
<p>After you prepare the input file, go to the <strong>Step 2:
Calculation</strong> tab, upload your input file, and calculate the
scores.</p>
