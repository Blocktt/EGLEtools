# Prepare an input file outside of the app

If you choose to create the input file outside of the app (versus using
the 'File Builder'), the comma-separated file (CSV) needs to have all
the required fields listed in the tables below. Column names must match
the spelling, symbology, and capitalization scheme exactly as shown.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you are using the proper Operational Taxonomic Unit
(OTU) and taxa traits/attributes for your metric calculations. The Taxa
Translator and Attribute tables (and associated metadata) that were used
for IBI development can be downloaded from the [***source TBD***].

The MI EGLE Input Test File can be used as a guide for your own input
file [***source TBD***].

## Input file requirements for bugs

```{r}
# Packages
library(readxl)
library(knitr)

# Data
fn_data <- "OutputFileSubtabs.xlsx"
path_data <- file.path("files", fn_data)
df_data <- read_excel(path_data, sheet = "FileBuild_Outside")

# Display
cap_data <- "Input file requirements for ELGE IBI models."
knitr::kable(df_data, "html", caption = cap_data)
```
