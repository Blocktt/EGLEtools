# Purpose

Create an input file with the proper Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs),
attributes, and index class for each calculation. This function performs
three steps to the input file:

1.  "Translates" the original TaxonID to the proper OTU based on the
    selected calculation.

2.  Appends the Michigan taxa attributes, which include phylogenetic
    data and traits.

3.  Appends the correct Index Class based on site coordinates.

The 'taxa translator' and attribute tables are based on biomonitoring
data from Michigan streams and will be updated regularly.

The Taxa Translator and Attribute tables (and associated metadata) that
were used for IBI development can be downloaded from the [***source
TBD***]. Note, that traits are not required for each record (i.e., trait
fields allow null values).

# Input File

There are multiple fields that the user is required to provide:

SampleID and TaxaID will be used to match the input file with the taxa
translator table and attributes table. N_Taxa will be summarized in
cases when more than one original TaxaID are translated to a single
TaxonID.

SiteID, Latitude, Longitude, and Stream Width are all necessary for
Index Class assignment. Note, that these fields must be complete for all
rows of the input file, otherwise, accidental duplication may occur
which will likely result in a malfunction or cause the app to crash.

It is acceptable for your input file to have the fields described above
named differently. Click on the drop-down menus. The list of fields in
your input file will appear. Select the correct column headings.

Other required fields and any option fields that should be carried
through into the output file (e.g., waterbody name, collection date,
etc.) should be specified by clicking on the 'Columns to keep in output'
box. The list of fields in your input file will appear. Click on the
fields that you want to include. If you change your mind and want to
remove a field, click on it and hit 'delete.' [IMPORTANT]{.underline}:
Do not add any of the required fields to this box as they are already
included from the drop-downs above.
