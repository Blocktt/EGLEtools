# Purpose

Create an input file with the proper Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)
and attributes for each calculation. This function performs two steps to
the input file:

1.  "Translates" the original TaxonID to the proper OTU based on the
    selected calculation.

2.  Appends the Michigan taxa attributes, which include phylogenetic data
    and traits.

The 'taxa translator' and attribute tables are based on biomonitoring data from Michigan streams and will be updated regularly.

Translator, Taxa Attributes, and Metadata</a> from Github page (look for
files starting with "FLCoral_BCG\_". Note, that traits are not required
for each record (i.e., trait fields allow null values).

# Input File

There are multiple fields that the user is required to provide:



SampleID and TaxaID will be used to match the input file with the taxa
translator table and attributes table. It is acceptable for your input
file to have these two fields named differently. Click on the drop-down
menus. The list of fields in your input file will appear. Select the
correct column headings.

Other required fields and any option fields that should be carried through into the output file (e.g.,
stationID, collection date, etc.) should be specified by clicking on the
'Columns to keep in output' box. The list of fields in your input file
will appear. Click on the fields that you want to include. If you change
your mind and want to remove a field, click on it and hit 'delete.'
[IMPORTANT]{.underline}: Do not add SampleID or TaxaID to this box as
they are already included from the drop-downs above.
