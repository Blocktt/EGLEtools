# **Preparing input files**

Input files must be either comma-separated values (CSV) or tab-separated
values (TSV). There are two options for preparing input files:

**Option 1**: Use the File Builder function to ensure that you are using
the proper taxa attributes and stream classes for the P51 calculation.
See the **Within the App: File Builder** sub-tab for details.

**Option 2**: Generate a file outside of the Shiny app that is ready to
go (i.e., has all the required fields, with exact column heading names).
See the **Outside the app** sub-tab for details.

After you prepare the input file, go to the **Step 2: Calculation** tab,
upload your input file, and calculate the scores.
